Welcome to the LangChain and Ray!

## Overview

LangChain and Ray are two Python libraries that are emerging as key components of the modern open source stack for LLMs (OSS LLMs). If you're a Python developer or a machine learning practitioner, these tools can be very helpful in rapidly developing LLM-based applications by making it easier to build and deploy these models.

This repo is as a go-to place for all technical examples and use cases on how to use these two libraries together.
